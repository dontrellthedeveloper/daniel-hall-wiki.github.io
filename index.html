And in doing so opens up its world, and yours, beautifully."<a href=""><sup>[49]</sup></a> Brian Truitt of USA Today awarded the film four out of four stars and called it Marvel Studios' best origin film since Guardians of the Galaxy.<a href=""><sup>[50]</sup></a> The film was also noted for its representation of black people and subject matter related to Afrofuturism.<a href=""><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>
